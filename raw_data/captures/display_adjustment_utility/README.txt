This capture was made by running the Apple Display  adjustment utility
under System 9. The IVAD i2c were lines externally monitored with an
ubuntu 16.04 computer using a Saleae Logic analyzer.

Each Property was recorded by sliding the bar from min to max.
The captures have the IVAD address 0x46 and the register offset for
each property along with the value sent for that property.

Each propertry is in a csv file named according to the name in the
program.

For example when I manipulated the "width" property and captured it,
I called that file "width.csv"
