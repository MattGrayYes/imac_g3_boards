RPiG3iMac       Contains the KiCAD project files for a Raspberry Pi HAT
                with power and activity LEDs. The HAT also has converts
                the incoming TTL RS232 signal to CMOS levels for use by
                the built in serial port.
            
RPiG3iMacJ20    Contains the KiCAD project files for a breakout board
                for the J3 and J5 headers on the J20 board. Once mounted
                one can connect regular wires via a terminal strip to
                interface with the two headers
